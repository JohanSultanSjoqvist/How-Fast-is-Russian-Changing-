# How-Fast-is-Russian-Changing-

In this repository the python-code for the bachelor thesis "How Fast is Russian Changing" is shown. This code has been used to calculate K-L divergence of frequency distributions of words in the Russian language over time. The coding has been done by Johan Sultán Sjöqvist, the author of the thesis, in Python. 

The repository includes the files, downloaded from the RNC (Национальный Корпус Русского Языка), that contain these aforementioned frequency distributions. The files were downloaded on 30th of September 2024.
